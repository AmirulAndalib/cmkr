# Target templates

To avoid repeating yourself in targets you can create your own target type (template). All properties of the template are inherited when used as a target type.

```toml
[project]
name = "templates"
description = "Target templates"

[template.app]
type = "executable"
sources = ["src/templates.cpp"]
compile-definitions = ["IS_APP"]

# Unlike interface targets you can also inherit properties
[template.app.properties]
CXX_STANDARD = "11"
CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED = true

[target.app-a]
type = "app"
compile-definitions = ["APP_A"]

[target.app-b]
type = "app"
compile-definitions = ["APP_B"]
```

**Note**: In most cases you probably want to use an [interface](/examples/interface) target instead.
