# Example project that sets compiler/linker flags for various platforms.

[project]
name = "compile-options"
description = "Compiler flags"

[target.hello]
type = "executable"
sources = ["src/main.cpp"]
msvc.compile-options = ["/W2"]
gcc.compile-options = ["-Wall"]
clang.compile-options = ["-Wall"]

# The `hello` target uses [conditions](/cmake-toml#conditions) to set different compiler flags depending on the platform. See the [targets](/cmake-toml/#targets) documentation for other things you can set.
# _Note_: In general you only want to specify flags _required_ to compile your code without errors.
